So back in December, I wanted to search for videos of people solving problems in Haskell so I can learn from them. You can go through LYAH and still struggle with how to go about solving a real world problem. It's tough even thinking about where to strart. 

Luckily for me, the first hit was Michael Gilliland's YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnw33kRSHT8736gwEERDswA) on solving Advent of Code 2019 (https://adventofcode.com/2019). The other Youtube channel I watch is Tsoding's channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEbYhDd6c6vngsF5PQpFVWg) on solving HackerRank problems in Haskell.

This repo is for me to attempt to solve Advent Of Code 2019 problems on my own, and if I get stuck at any point, follow Michael's Youtube video until I get to a point where I feel I can get past my sticking point, and rinse and repeat.
