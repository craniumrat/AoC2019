While doing this, I had no idea how to do this, so I basically re-did Michael Gilliland's solution.

I learnt about Control.Monad.guard to filter monadic expressions. He also used a very interesting way to test adjacent digits using the string representation of the integer

When it came to part 2, I stopped at the point where Michael import'ed Data.List.group. From then, it was a simple thought to get to the correct answer.
