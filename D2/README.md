You might know the fundamentals of Haskell, but understanding how to use existing libraries is still hard. This is one of those cases, where I was stuck at scratch.

Thanks to Michael Gilliland for his video explaining how to solve this. I had to watch and figure out the entire implementation before I could try and write this on my own.

This is the first time I have used tuples and Maybe's and do statements outside toy projects, so it's been a huge learning experience. Also, after watching Micheal's code, I understood how to chain the same function so that things are still functional.

Also, I learnt that we should prefer to use type signatures to narrow down errors. I also used Debug.Trace.trace function to view intermediate results.
